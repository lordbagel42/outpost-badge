# ssd1680.py -- minimal raw driver for the Outpost badge 2.9" e-ink panel
#
# Panel: 0290BN800F6HP-DL  (2.9", 296x128, SSD1680 controller)
# Board: Outpost badge, RP2354A
#
# Wiring (from the KiCad netlist -> RP2350 GPIO numbers):
#   CS   = GP13    SCK  = GP14 (SPI1 SCK)    MOSI = GP15 (SPI1 TX)
#   BUSY = GP16    DC   = GP17               RST  = GP18
#
# We drive the controller with raw commands (no displayio) so we can do
# fast PARTIAL refresh, which displayio.EPaperDisplay does not expose.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# SPEED, AND WHAT IT COSTS
#
# Measured on this panel at room temperature:
#     full refresh                    2.29  s   0.44 fps
#     stock partial refresh           0.617 s   1.6  fps
#     + charge pump held up           0.478 s   2.1  fps   <- free
#     + shortened waveform            0.107 s   9.4  fps   <- costs contrast
#
# Three things produce that. Two are free, one is not:
#   1. arm_partial() does the setup ONCE (analog power up, LUT load) and
#      frame_nopower() runs only the per-frame part. A normal driver pays a
#      ~139 ms charge-pump cycle on every frame. Free: no waveform changes.
#   2. The custom LUT shortens the drive from ~438 ms to ~40 ms. NOT free.
#      Contrast follows total panel time and nothing else changes that. At
#      ~10 ms of drive the animation still runs but no image is visible.
#   3. sync_old=True keeps the reference RAM correct. Costs ~5% speed and is
#      mandatory -- see the warning below.
#
# Ideas that measured as WORTHLESS on this panel (do not re-try them blind):
#   * driving fewer gate lines / a window -- 296 lines 0.05048 s vs 32 lines
#     0.05109 s. The LUT frame period comes from the controller oscillator and
#     does not scale with line count. A game CANNOT save time by updating a
#     small region.
#   * reusing the loaded LUT (0x22=0xC7), and registers 0x3A / 0x3B.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THREE WARNINGS. The first two were real failures, not theory.
#
# 1. ALWAYS pass sync_old=True to frame_nopower().
#    Without it the panel ratchets one direction and stops responding after
#    ~80 frames. Nothing in the timing shows it: the broken version held a
#    rock-steady 18.4 fps with normal BUSY times while the panel was dead.
#    See frame_nopower() for the mechanism.
#
# 2. ALWAYS call init() before a full refresh that follows arm_partial().
#    arm_partial() leaves the custom LUT in 0x32 and overwrites the voltage
#    registers 0x03/0x04/0x2C. Nothing restores the factory table, so a plain
#    display_full() afterwards runs the SHORT waveform: measured 0.613 s
#    instead of 2.29 s, and almost invisible on the panel.
#        epd.init()              # software reset -> factory LUT from OTP
#        epd.display_full(buf)
#
# 3. ALWAYS call power_off() when you finish with the fast path, from a
#    `finally` and not an `except`.
#    A full refresh ends with 0x22=0xF7, whose low bits disable analog and
#    clock, so display_full()/display_base() power down by themselves. The fast
#    path does not: arm_partial() deliberately leaves the charge pump up and
#    only power_off() lowers it. If a program stops without calling it, the
#    panel's high-voltage supply stays energised.
#
#        try:
#            epd.arm_partial(...)
#            while True:
#                epd.frame_nopower(buf, sync_old=True)
#        finally:
#            epd.power_off()
#
#    `except KeyboardInterrupt` is NOT sufficient. CircuitPython's auto-reload
#    fires whenever a file is copied to the drive and does not raise
#    KeyboardInterrupt, and neither does an unexpected exception; both skip an
#    except-only handler.
#
#    What this costs is certain for current draw -- the supply simply stays on,
#    which matters on a battery. Whether a sustained bias also harms the panel
#    is standard e-paper guidance rather than something measured here; we did
#    not test it. Treat it as a reason to be strict, not as a known failure.
#
# Also worth knowing: display_base() is a full-strength 2.29 s refresh, so
# whatever it shows is burned in hard and leaves the strongest ghost on the
# panel. Seed it with a blank background, not with real content.
#
# Changes from a stock SSD1680 driver:
#   * arm_partial() / frame_nopower() split the setup from the per-frame work.
#   * load_partial_lut() exposes tpa, frame_rate and groups (the drive time).
#   * frame_nopower(sync_old=) writes the old RAM after each update.
#   * _wait(poll=) and frame_nopower(poll=) run a callback inside the BUSY
#     wait, so button taps shorter than one frame are not lost. Sampling there
#     costs no frame rate -- it is time the CPU already spends idle.
