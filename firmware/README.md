# Outpost badge firmware

**Status: work in progress. This is capability-testing firmware, not a product.**

The purpose of this code is to find out what the board can actually do and to
prove that a given board works: the RP2354A, the USB stack, the SSD1680 e-paper
panel, and the buttons. Everything here exists to answer a question or to
demonstrate a capability. Nothing here is a finished application.

Written in collaboration with Claude.

A note on the numbers here. Timings come from the board's own serial output, so
frame rates and refresh times are real measurements. Contrast is not: every
"good", "worse" or "too faint" in this folder is a judgement by eye, made from
A/B runs at matched frame rates. No optical instrument was used.

## What is proven

## Board facts

- **MCU:** RP2354A — an RP2350 with 2 MB of stacked internal flash. There is no
  external flash IC. It programs over the normal BOOTSEL USB bootloader.
- **Panel:** `0290BN800F6HP-DL`, 2.9 inch, 296x128, SSD1680 controller.
- **CircuitPython:** the stock `raspberry_pi_pico2` build works unchanged. The
  RP2 port reads the flash size from the chip's JEDEC ID, so CIRCUITPY sizes
  itself to the internal 2 MB.

The buttons are wired switch-to-ground: enable an internal pull-up and read a
press as a low level. Confirmed on hardware by playing `epaper/examples/flappy.py`.

The LED (D4) is driven by the NFC chip, not by a GPIO, so it cannot be used as a
"hello world" blink.

### Orientation

Landscape with the FPC cable to the **left**. The native row axis (296) runs
horizontally and the column axis (128) runs vertically. A vertical run on screen
is a contiguous bit run inside one panel row, which is the cheap drawing
primitive. See [epaper/README.md](epaper/README.md) for the full geometry notes.

## Layout

Work is split by subsystem. Each subsystem owns its own document, examples and
experiment trail. `lib/` and `tools/` are shared, because subsystems will
eventually be used together and a driver buried inside one of them is awkward to
import from the other. Only `epaper/` exists so far; NFC would be added as a
sibling.

```

### lib/

- `ssd1680.py` — raw SSD1680 driver: full refresh, stock partial refresh, and
  the fast partial path (custom LUT, charge pump held up, old-RAM sync).

### epaper/examples/

- `gradient.py` — scrolling dithered gradient
  ([video](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019ff91d-8611-714b-98ba-4ad0f98be064/img_1216__yafw_balanced_.mp4)).
  This is the reference setting: 9.4 fps, confirmed good contrast. Use it to
  check a board end to end.
- `ball.py` — bouncing ball with free-fall physics
  ([video](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019ff91c-ea26-7483-82a6-17ceeb6396bf/img_1219__yafw_balanced_.mp4)).
  Solid black, which is a harder case for a short waveform than a dithered grey.
- `flappy.py` — Flappy Bird at ~8.9 fps
  ([video](https://cdn.hackclub.com/019ff91c-0464-7b39-83fa-bce072a783c1/img_1220__yafw_balanced_.mp4)).
  Buttons flap; set `AUTO_PILOT = True` for the computer player.

### tools/ (shared)

- `deploy.sh` — copy `lib/` and one script onto a mounted CIRCUITPY.
- `monitor.py` — read the board's serial console.

### epaper/tools/

- `recondition.py` — **ghost remover.** Run it when the panel shows residual
  images. It restores the factory waveform and drives 8 full black-white
  inversions. One white refresh does not clear deep ghosting.
- `compare.py` — A/B contrast harness. Runs two settings at the same frame rate
  with letter cards between them, so contrast can be judged by eye without the
  frame rate confusing the comparison.

## Quick start

```bash
./firmware/tools/deploy.sh gradient
```

Then watch the console:

```bash
python3 firmware/tools/monitor.py /dev/cu.usbmodem101 20 passive
```

The argument to `deploy.sh` is a bare name or a path under `firmware/`:

```bash
./firmware/tools/deploy.sh flappy
./firmware/tools/deploy.sh epaper/examples/ball.py
./firmware/tools/deploy.sh recondition
```

`lib/*.py` goes to `CIRCUITPY/lib/`, and the chosen script becomes
`CIRCUITPY/code.py`. CircuitPython re-runs `code.py` on every save, so copying a
file restarts the program. Pass `passive` to `monitor.py` to avoid sending
Ctrl-C and Ctrl-D on top of that auto-restart.

## Three rules that are not optional

The first two are explained with measurements in
[epaper/README.md](epaper/README.md). All three are also documented at the top of
`lib/ssd1680.py`, next to the code they apply to.

1. **Keep the old RAM in sync during partial refresh.** Use
   `frame_nopower(..., sync_old=True)`. Without it, charge accumulates in one
   direction and the panel stops responding after about 80 frames, with no sign
   of trouble in the timing data.
2. **Call `epd.init()` before any full refresh that follows `arm_partial()`.**
   `arm_partial()` leaves the custom waveform loaded, so a plain full refresh
   runs the short waveform and is almost invisible: 0.613 s instead of 2.29 s.
3. **Call `epd.power_off()` when you finish, from a `finally`.**
   `arm_partial()` leaves the charge pump up on purpose — that is where the
   free speed comes from — and only `power_off()` lowers it. A full refresh
   powers down inside its own sequence; the fast path does not.

   `except KeyboardInterrupt` is not enough. CircuitPython's auto-reload fires
   every time `deploy.sh` copies a file, and it does not raise
   `KeyboardInterrupt`; neither does an unexpected exception. Both skip an
   except-only handler and leave the supply energised.

   ```python
   try:
       epd.arm_partial(tpa=2, frame_rate=0x44, groups=None)
       while True:
           epd.frame_nopower(buf, sync_old=True)
   finally:
       epd.power_off()
   ```

## If the panel looks wrong

- **Ghosting or faint leftover images** — run `./firmware/tools/deploy.sh
recondition`.
- **A weak or invisible full refresh** — a missing `epd.init()`; see rule 2.
- **Motion stops after a few seconds** — a missing old-RAM sync; see rule 1.
- **Everything mirrored** — `FLIP_X` / `FLIP_Y` in `epaper/examples/flappy.py`. Note
  that a coordinate flip and the viewing inversion cancel for a static shape, so
  text does **not** need extra mirroring on top of `FLIP_X`.
