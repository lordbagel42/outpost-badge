# shape_probe.py -- drive_probe + exactly one change: single sine period.
#
# Exactly ONE variable is changed from the run that was confirmed to look good:
# the frame count. Everything else is byte-for-byte the original -- same 16
# precomputed frames, same folded-triangle ramp along the ROW axis (so the
# double peaks are back; that is intentional, this is the known-good baseline),
# same 20 MHz SPI, same DISPLAY Mode 1 (0x04), same *absent* old-RAM sync.
#
# The original did not fail. It was a fixed 120-frame run that finished:
#     --> maximum (tpa=1 fr=0xFF groups=1)
#         18.4 fps end-to-end (54.3 ms/frame)
#     done -- clean full refresh.
#     Code done running.
# It "froze" because it ran out of frames and exited, not because of the panel.
#
# What we are testing here: does that same picture hold up past 120 frames, and
# if it degrades, how does it degrade and when? Do NOT add a fix to this file.
# If it walks toward black, that is the result -- record it, then change one
# variable in a separate file and compare against this.
#
# Ctrl-C is the stop. It powers down and leaves a clean full refresh.
