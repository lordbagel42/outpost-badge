# flappy.py -- automated Flappy Bird on the e-paper panel.
#
# Display settings are the confirmed milestone (shape_probe.py): tpa=2, frame
# rate 0x44, 3 groups, sync_old=True, mode 0x04. Measured 9.4 fps, panel
# 99.8 ms, 40 ms of drive. The game runs at that tick and the physics constants
# suit it, not 60 fps.
#
# No buttons are wired, so an auto-pilot plays. It aims the bird at the middle
# of the next gap and flaps whenever the bird is below it.
#
# LOOKAHEAD is 0 on purpose. A 3-frame prediction was the first attempt and it
# died at the first pipe in every game: "by + vy*3 > target" fires a flap while
# the bird is still ~12 px ABOVE the target, and each flap lifts it 12 px more,
# so the oscillation centre climbs until the bird clips the top of the gap.
# With no prediction the bird oscillates around the target instead of above it.
#
# GRAVITY, FLAP and LOOKAHEAD come from a host-side parameter sweep, not from
# guesswork. At these values: 20 games x 20000 frames, zero deaths, and the
# bird stays inside y = 23..105 of a 0..127 panel.
#
# Drawing cost matters here, unlike the pre-rendered demos. Only ~7 ms of each
# frame is not panel time, so live drawing eats frame rate directly. The first
# version cost 21.4 ms of CPU and dropped the game to 7.8 fps. Two things fixed
# it, and both remove repeated work rather than making the work faster:
#   * the ground line is baked into a background buffer, not redrawn on 296
#     rows every frame;
#   * every row of a pipe is identical and a pipe's gap never changes while it
#     scrolls, so its 16-byte row is built once at spawn and then assigned.
#
# Orientation: landscape, FPC cable LEFT. The native row axis (296) runs
# horizontally on screen and the column axis (128) runs vertically. Screen
# coordinates below are (x across, y down). If the bird falls UPWARDS set
# FLIP_Y = True; if the pipes travel the wrong way set FLIP_X = True.
