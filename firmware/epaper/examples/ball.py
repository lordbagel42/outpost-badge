# ball.py -- bouncing ball, same display settings as the good gradient.
#
# Display configuration is identical to shape_probe.py, which is the confirmed
# milestone: tpa=2, frame rate 0x44, 3 groups, sync_old=True, mode 0x04.
# Measured there: 9.4 fps, panel 99.8 ms, 40 ms of drive. Only the picture is
# new, so any difference you see comes from the image, not from the settings.
#
# Orientation: landscape, FPC cable LEFT. The native row axis (NROWS=296) runs
# horizontally and the column axis (WIDTH=128) runs vertically. The ball moves
# vertically, so it moves along the COLUMN axis. A vertical span inside one row
# is a contiguous run of bits, so each row of the ball costs a few byte writes.
#
# Motion: free fall, not a sine. A sine spends equal time at the top and the
# bottom; a real ball hangs at the apex and reverses hard at the ground. Between
# impacts the ball is in free fall, so its height is a parabola:
#     height(t) = 4 * H * t * (1 - t),  t = 0 at the ground, t = 0.5 at the apex
# The ball touches the bottom, and at the apex its upper edge reaches 75 percent
# of the panel height. Frames are evenly spaced in t, so the steps are small at
# the top and large near the ground -- which is what free fall looks like.
#
# SQUASH deforms the ball on the contact frame: wider across, shorter up and
# down, base still on the ground. Set it to False for a rigid ball.
#
# One prediction to check: the gradient is made of dithered greys, and grey
# needs less drive than solid black. This ball is solid black, which is the
# harder case for a short waveform. It may look weaker than the gradient at the
# same setting. If it does, the fix is more drive time, not a different bug.
